=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::EN::Pseudolocalize qw( convert deconvert );

    my $text = 'Widdly scuds?';

    my $pl_text = convert($text);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package contains utilities for pseudolocalizing English or similar languages expressable in the ASCII character set.

Applications created or maintained by English-speaking developers may suffer from overlooked Unicode support due to the ASCII, latin1, Windows CP1252,  and utf8 encodings being equivalent for the code points used in English. You may think that your application is Unicode-friendly, but it's easy to forget to test for extended character support. It goes overlooked until a customer pastes in some decorative quotes from MS Word and you end up with mojibake in your app.

This module will convert your basic Latin characters to similar-looking characters that are much higher on the code plane. This process is called pseudolocalization, and it will very quickly expose a few common errors in encoding support.

DO NOT USE THIS MODULE IN PRODUCTION. Use it in read-only mode, or on a test data set. It should make round-trip conversions just fine, but if you have data in your application that is in the conversion table, no effort is made to preserve your data. It might end up stripping out all the diacritics from your data, and that would ruin your comprehensive database of melodic Finnish folk-metal bands.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item convert($text)

Converts $text into pseudolocalized text using a simple mapping table. A few pairs are combined into single characters with ligatures, while the rest are simple one-to-one mappings.

Returns: the converted string

=item deconvert($text)

Reverses the process of convert() using the same mapping table.

Returns: the converted string
